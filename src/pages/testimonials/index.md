      I have worked with Karen on several projects now and she is a dedicated,
      thorough and lovely person to work with. Her attention to detail and work ethic
      is excellent. She’s a diligent researcher and responds well to every brief. I
      would not hesitate to recommend her for any copywriting or content creation work.

      Karen was an excellent addition to our team, and contributed to several of
      our titles, including National Geographic Traveller, National Geographic Traveller
      Food, Postcards and Worldwide Destination Guide. She worked diligently and enthusiastically
      on multiple projects, including writing and researching original content, picture
      research and sub-editing. Karen was a pleasure to have in the office, and I was
      impressed by her passion, work ethic and flexibility. She will be a great addition
      to any organisation in the future and I wish her the best as in her career.

      I am extremely happy with Karen's work. She wrote all the copy for my subscription
      box ecommerce website, writing engaging and informative text to show off my company.
      She wrote the landing page info, welcome letter, sales pages, product description,
      my story, FAQs, contact page - the entire site. She created two taglines for my
      company - one for the product, 'Relax - Replenish - Revitalize', and one to engage
      prospective customers to make a call to action 'Because carers need care too'.
      She wrote me a script and gave me content strategies for my social media platforms
      and gave me advice on marketing techniques to help me gain traffic. Her writing
      is very high quality and she's great to work with - very helpful, friendly, goes
      above and beyond the project requirement, and genuinely cares about her clients
      and helping them get their business up and running. I'll definitely hire her again
      and I'd highly recommend her for any project.

      Karen is my script writer for season 2 of my travel show 'Traveling with
      Denella Ri'chard'. I am very happy with her work so have asked her to work on
      the whole season. Her writing has flair and insight. She understands the tone
      of voice, theme and message that I want my show to give, and her words contribute
      greatly to spreading that message. Her travel knowledge is broad and she has first-hand
      knowledge of many worldwide destinations which, along with her great research
      skills, make her an expert writer in the travel genre. She's a very hard worker
      and produces high-quality copy, and works well to tight deadlines when needed.
      I'd highly recommend her for any content, copywriting or script writing project
      and will be continuing to use her services for my show.

      I was very happy with Karen’s services. She provided me with a very well-written
      optimized SEO article for my blog that connected well with my reader demographic.
      She created a detailed content strategy for my social media accounts on Facebook
      and Instagram and provided me with full website analysis and created an insightful
      business strategy to improve traffic and user experience. Her work is thorough,
      well-researched and high-quality. I’ll definitely hire her again and would recommend
      her to anyone looking to connect with or extend their customer base.

      Karen did a meticulous job proofreading my portfolio website and LinkedIn
      profile. She catches every tiny error, which made my work look professional. She
      works quickly and precisely and I’d recommend her for any proofreading work to
      give any brand the polished, professional look everyone wants.

      Among the many students I tutor in the art of copywriting, Karen really stood
      out. Every piece of work she submitted was meticulously researched and her rationale
      regarding approach was explained in thorough detail. She consistently went above
      and beyond to produce work of a very high standard. I have no doubt that this
      enthusiasm, commitment and attention to detail will translate into her client
      work. If anyone needs a copywriter, especially one with a passion for travel,
      Karen will give 100% to any project.

      Karen is meticulous with her proofreading skills, reliable at delivering
      correct, concise copy, and she edits very well helping shape the tone and structure
      of the work in a way to get the best out of the piece. She successfully negotiated
      the course and achieved a Distinction grade. I have found her to be intelligent,
      keen to listen to advice and diligent. Karen possesses many good qualities and
      is capable of thinking “outside the box”. She is also not afraid to ask questions
      when she is unsure of something.

      Karen was one of the top performers within the first few months she started
      and was always striving to exceed those targets with new marketing ideas. Karen
      was always someone I could count on. She has been one of the reasons why I enjoy
      working with On-board Sales.
