## Thank you for checking out my portfolio.

My name is Karen. I’m a copywriter, content writer and travel junkie living in Edinburgh, Scotland.

A few of the brands I’ve worked with since 2017 include: National Geographic Traveller (UK), Holland America Line, ASTA Worldwide Destinations Guide, ABTA, Postcards, and Flight Centre.

Before discovering the joys of content and copywriting: I spent 15 years working on cruise ships in entertainment and then sales and marketing selling cruises; managed entertainment and sang in Spain; taught English in Italy; and backpacked around the US.

I created a website about travel by cruise ship giving tips on what to do in ports, and advice on travel and ship life CruiseShipKaren.com

Words have always been my thing, from speaking them while hosting and managing entertainment teams, singing them as a vocalist, teaching them while English teaching and learning other languages, to writing them to inform, educate, entertain, inspire and persuade.

I have you covered for any type of content, weaving words to spice up the narrative of your product or story, researching thoroughly and creating the message you need.
