### Thank you for checking out my portfolio.

My name is Karen. I’m a copywriter, content writer and travel junkie living in Edinburgh, Scotland.

A few of the brands I’ve worked with since 2017 include: National Geographic Traveller (UK), Holland America Line, ASTA Worldwide Destinations Guide, ABTA, Postcards, and Flight Centre.

Before discovering the joys of content and copywriting: I spent 15 years working on cruise ships in entertainment and then sales and marketing selling cruises; managed entertainment and sang in Spain; taught English in Italy; and backpacked around the US.

I created a website about travel by cruise ship giving tips on what to do in ports, and advice on travel and ship life [CruiseShipKaren.com](https://CruiseShipKaren.com)

Words have always been my thing, from speaking them while hosting and managing entertainment teams, singing them as a vocalist, teaching them while English teaching and learning other languages, to writing them to inform, educate, entertain, inspire and persuade.

I have you covered for any type of content, weaving words to spice up the narrative of your product or story, researching thoroughly and creating the message you need.
