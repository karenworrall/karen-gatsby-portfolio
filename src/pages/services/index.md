faqs:
  - header: Why do I need a content writer or copywriter?
    content: |
      There are a myriad of options available nowadays for almost every service or product imaginable. Whatever you do or sell, you have a lot of competition for it.
      So, you want to stand out.
      To do that, you need to have good copy.
      A professional copywriter makes your words, message, product and services stand out and grabs the attention of your current and potential customers.
      A professional content writer tells your story, or whatever informative, educational or entertaining stories you need to help your customers.
  - header: Why do I need a proofreader or editor?
    content: |
      Some people think poor grammar, spelling and punctuation are acceptable.
      But many people – and certainly all high-calibre businesses – don’t.
      Good spelling, grammar and punctuation are what makes your business give a great first impression, showing that you’re professional, credible and easy to understand.
      Many businesses will write off any company that has typos and bad spelling in their websites, social media or emails to customers.
      Avoid that by hiring me to check over your content with a fine-tooth comb before publishing.
  - header: How does it work?
    content: |
      Contact me and we’ll arrange to chat over the phone or by video chat about your needs and how I can help you with them. Once we’ve fully talked this through, we’ll create a brief and I’ll use this to give you a quote and contract.
      Once you’re happy to proceed, you pay a 50% deposit up front and I’ll start the work. I’ll give you the first draft and we’ll discuss any tweaks you require to make sure you’re happy. Once it’s finished and you’re happy, you’ll pay the other 50%.
      For proofreading and editing work, you’ll send me the document (or at least a section of it) and I’ll advise you what level of editing I’d recommend before giving you a quote.
  - header: Can you create my website for me?
    content: |
